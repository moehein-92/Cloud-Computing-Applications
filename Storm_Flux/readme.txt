Overview
Welcome to the Storm machine practice. The final goal of this assignment is to build a system that finds the top N words in a given corpus. We will build the assignment step by step on top of the system in the tutorial.

Exercise A - Build a Storm topology to count words from a spout that randomly generates sentences
 

Exercise B - Modify topology from Exercise A to get the input sentences from a file
 

Exercise C - Add a normalizer in topology from exercise B to make input words lowercase and remove common english words
 

Exercise D - Obtain and store the top N words, based on occurrence frequency, from the topology in exercise C

2 General Requirements
All these assignments are designed to work on the Docker image that we provide.
